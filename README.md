# 9fin - Snap

by Jonny Farmer

## JavaScript Version

### To Run
 - Clone this repository
 - `cd 9fin` and `cd JS`
 - Open index.html in your browser (preferably Chrome).
 - To run tests, `cd test` and open index.html in your browser (preferably Chrome).
 
### Notes
Overall I really enjoyed this project.  I have been using React for all my recent projects so it was fun going back to using the DOM and vanilla JS.  I created a very simple front end.  My methodology was to pseudo code the steps, then create functions for each task.

I also did some simple testing using the Mocha and Chai frameworks (but no installation required).


## Python Version

### To Run
 - (Assuming you have Python installed on your computer)
 - Clone this repository
 - `cd 9fin` and `cd Python`
 - `python app.py` to run Snap
 - To run tests, `cd test` and run `python tests.py`

### Notes
Having much more limited Python experience than Javascript, this took me a little longer but I enjoyed it more.  I used the same pseudo code and created a function for each task.

I have never done any python testing before, so taught myself some basic python unit testing.
